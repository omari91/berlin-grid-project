### 2. Fill in Project Details

**Project Name:**
```
Berlin Grid Digital Twin - Redispatch 3.0 Simulation
```

**Project URL:**
```
https://github.com/omari91/berlin-grid-project
```

**Start Date:** November 2024  
**End Date:** December 2024 (or "Present" if ongoing)

**Project Description** (Copy & Paste):
```
Developed enterprise-grade Python simulation demonstrating decentralized grid control per §14a EnWG and VDE-AR-N 4110 standards. 

Key Achievements:
• Implemented fuzzy-logic control algorithm for Redispatch 3.0 grid congestion management
• Validated simulation against real Berlin grid data (2.04M devices, 63 MVA transformer)
• Built CI/CD pipeline with automated testing (pytest), code quality checks (mypy), and Docker containerization
• Demonstrated compliance with German energy regulations and VDE technical standards

Technologies: Python, pandapower, pytest, GitHub Actions, Docker
Skills: Power Systems Engineering, Grid Resilience, Software Testing, DevOps, German Energy Regulations

The project showcases both rapid prototyping capabilities (working analysis script) and enterprise engineering practices (modular architecture, CI/CD, automated testing) - essential for modern grid digitalization roles.
```

**Associated With:**
```
IEEE | VDI | VDE
```

### 3. Optional: Create a LinkedIn Post

**Post Text Template:**
```
Excited to share my latest project: Berlin Grid Digital Twin 🔌

I developed an enterprise-grade simulation demonstrating how decentralized "fuzzy logic" control can manage grid congestion more effectively than traditional N-1 planning methods - specifically addressing Germany's §14a EnWG Redispatch 3.0 requirements.

🎯 Key achievements:
✅ Validated against real Berlin Energienetze data (2.04M devices)
✅ VDE-AR-N 4110 compliant implementation  
✅ CI/CD pipeline with automated testing & Docker
✅ Full methodology documentation

The project demonstrates both technical depth (power system simulation, voltage stability) and software engineering maturity (testing, CI/CD, containerization) - crucial skills for grid modernization roles.
